# Pick and Place Challenge (MEAM 5200)

In this project, we utilize inverse kinematics alongside computer vision to enable a 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) robot to pick up both static and dynamic blocks and stack them in an organized manner.

### Key Contributions:

- **April Tag Detection**: Developed Python code for accurate detection of April tags on both static and dynamic blocks, allowing the Franka-Emika Panda robot to pick them up with precise end effector alignment.
- **Noise Reduction**: Implemented a median filter to reduce noise in April tag detection caused by varying light conditions, successfully stacking 4 static blocks and 2 dynamic blocks on top of each other.
